# Wordpress OpenAI Search plugin

by [Procoders](https://procoders.tech/)

The OpenAI Search plugin indexes the content of your blog posts using the embeddings feature of OpenAI. 

## How it works?
Embeddings are a way to represent the meaning of words and phrases in a way that can be understood by computers. By analyzing the content of your posts and generating these embeddings, the plugin is able to provide more relevant search results to users who are looking for specific content on your site.

* An AI summary response of the most relevant results based on the content of the indexed blog posts
* The most relevant search results based on the content of the indexed blog posts, along with a temperature label (0-100) that indicates the "creativity" or "diversity" of the results
* Links to the indexed blog posts that match the user's search query.
